Changelog of flooding-lib
===================================================


2.1 (unreleased)
----------------

Overhaul of the approval system. From now on, there will be no
Task-based approval, nor any project-wide 'approved' checkbox. The only
thing we will use is the approval objects from approvaltool, and their
contents will be changed.

Steps taken:
- A large migration removes all the existing approval objects, creates
  a new approval type with one rule ('is this project approved?') and
  for each scenario, connects this approval type to it. The successful
  property of the rule is set based on the old Task-based status.

- Made 'type' in approvaltool.ApprovalObjectType unique. This is the
  identifier we shall be using that relates projects' default approval
  types to database rows in this table.

- Each project now has a field 'approval_object_type' that defines which
  approval object type scenarios in it will use. All existing projects use
  the default one (hand edit ROR and Landelijk gebied when this change
  goes live).

- Scenario.approval_object() method creates the approval object if it
  doesn't exist yet, using the project's default.

- Scenario.main_approval_object() method that does the same but only for
  the main project.

- Add helper functions to ApprovalObject: setup() to create a new
  approvalobject that also enters ApprovalObjectState lines into the
  database, and approved() and disapproved() properties that check
  whether all or some of the states have been filled in.

- Change Scenario.update_status() so that it looks at the approval object
  of the main project for approved and disapproved status. Tasks for
  approval and disapproval are now obsolete.

- Removed the old UI for task-based approval

- Added a ApprovalObjectLog model that logs the history of a certain
  approvalobject/rule combination, ApprovalObjectState doesn't do that
  anymore

Improved the scenario sharing pages.

Approvers of scenarios that they have offered to other projects can
now see the status of their scenarios' approvals in those other
projects.

If a scenario is now approved on some rules and not yet judged on
others (their value is null), it is now neither approved nor
disapproved. Used to be disapproved in this situation. A scenario is
disapproved if its success value is False for at least one of the
rules.

Improved the translations somewhat.

2.0 (2012-07-09)
----------------

"Het kan wel eens 2.0 worden"
  -- Martijn Siemerink, 2012


Solved issue Trac #3684

  After an individual scenario upload, the user can optionally upload
  files.  After uploading, the site used to redirect immediately to
  the import overview screen, but now it redirects to a tiny screen
  with a success message and a link to the overview screen.

Solved issue Trac #3711

  In the export CSV view (flooding_lib.views.scenario_list), ASCII
  strings were used in combination with user-defined data. This led to
  Unicode decoding errors. Working with Unicode only solves the
  problem.

  Instead of writing a CSV file to disk and then reading it back in to
  send it to the browser, we just send it there directly.

  Added a util/csvutil.py to work with Unicode CSV files.

  CSV file generation may well hit timeout limits, depends on the
  query parameters.

1.39 (2012-07-06)
-----------------

We are testing and fixed the following issues:

- Restored a scenario.project_id field for the benefit of the old uitvoerder.py scripts

- Forgot to set field.value_str instead of field.value for the
  scenario ID that we hack into the info window by hand

- 999 was also sometimes used as a sentinel, just like -999. Ignore it too.

- Changed another .project to .main_project

- We should really use Unicode everywhere, people use non-ASCII
  characters and there's no reason why we should crash on them

- Added an 'ignore' directory to .gitignore, helpful to put silly
  temporary files in


1.38.1 (2012-07-06)
-------------------

- Fixed two occurences of 'scenario.project' that should be
  'scenario.main_project' now.


1.38 (2012-07-06)
-----------------

- Solved issues from Trac #3682. In the scenario info window:
  - Coordinates are shown in RD, not WGS84
  - Intervals are shown as '2 d 12:00', not as 2.5
  - Values like '-999' are treated as null values

1.37 (2012-07-02)
-----------------

- Fix issues relating to #3705; obviously import wasn't tested yet and
  there were several typos and things that couldn't work. Works on my
  development machine now.


1.36 (2012-07-02)
-----------------

- Changed scenario fields to null=True to make testing easier

- Added ScenarioProject model

- Changed most of them to new, tested functions

- Changed scenario fields to null=True to make testing easier

- Added 'color_mapping_name' field to 'Project' model (the field
  exists yet, fake it on migration).


1.35 (2012-06-26)
-----------------

- Add breadcrumbs to add files screen in import (#3687)

- Make WAITING the default state for new ImportScenarios (#3685)

- Large scale code formatting (pep8/pyflakes), down to 0 errors from
  ~2300

- Refactor and test import code some more (move functionality from
  views into models)

- Fixed import of Image.

- Added tests for get_scenarios() in UserPermissionManager, test
  multiple projects per scenario

- Got tests to work -- multiple projects per scenario is functional
  now

1.34 (2012-06-20)
-----------------

- Changed the scenario information window. It now:
  - Shows all the headers and fields from the import new scenario screen
  - Adds scenario id, attachments
  To do:
  - some nice things of the old version should be included, like the graph
  - some things have unexpected 'missing' values (like 999) and we don't
    filter for them yet

1.33 (2012-06-15)
-----------------

- Add south migrations for all the apps.
