Changelog of flooding-lib
===================================================

2.0.2 (unreleased)
------------------

- Nothing changed yet.

2.0 (2012-07-09)
----------------

"Het kan wel eens 2.0 worden"
  -- Martijn Siemerink, 2012


Solved issue Trac #3684

  After an individual scenario upload, the user can optionally upload
  files.  After uploading, the site used to redirect immediately to
  the import overview screen, but now it redirects to a tiny screen
  with a success message and a link to the overview screen.

Solved issue Trac #3711

  In the export CSV view (flooding_lib.views.scenario_list), ASCII
  strings were used in combination with user-defined data. This led to
  Unicode decoding errors. Working with Unicode only solves the
  problem.

  Instead of writing a CSV file to disk and then reading it back in to
  send it to the browser, we just send it there directly.

  Added a util/csvutil.py to work with Unicode CSV files.

  CSV file generation may well hit timeout limits, depends on the
  query parameters.

1.39 (2012-07-06)
-----------------

We are testing and fixed the following issues:

- Restored a scenario.project_id field for the benefit of the old uitvoerder.py scripts

- Forgot to set field.value_str instead of field.value for the
  scenario ID that we hack into the info window by hand

- 999 was also sometimes used as a sentinel, just like -999. Ignore it too.

- Changed another .project to .main_project

- We should really use Unicode everywhere, people use non-ASCII
  characters and there's no reason why we should crash on them

- Added an 'ignore' directory to .gitignore, helpful to put silly
  temporary files in


1.38.1 (2012-07-06)
-------------------

- Fixed two occurences of 'scenario.project' that should be
  'scenario.main_project' now.


1.38 (2012-07-06)
-----------------

- Solved issues from Trac #3682. In the scenario info window:
  - Coordinates are shown in RD, not WGS84
  - Intervals are shown as '2 d 12:00', not as 2.5
  - Values like '-999' are treated as null values

1.37 (2012-07-02)
-----------------

- Fix issues relating to #3705; obviously import wasn't tested yet and
  there were several typos and things that couldn't work. Works on my
  development machine now.


1.36 (2012-07-02)
-----------------

- Changed scenario fields to null=True to make testing easier

- Added ScenarioProject model

- Changed most of them to new, tested functions

- Changed scenario fields to null=True to make testing easier

- Added 'color_mapping_name' field to 'Project' model (the field
  exists yet, fake it on migration).


1.35 (2012-06-26)
-----------------

- Add breadcrumbs to add files screen in import (#3687)

- Make WAITING the default state for new ImportScenarios (#3685)

- Large scale code formatting (pep8/pyflakes), down to 0 errors from
  ~2300

- Refactor and test import code some more (move functionality from
  views into models)

- Fixed import of Image.

- Added tests for get_scenarios() in UserPermissionManager, test
  multiple projects per scenario

- Got tests to work -- multiple projects per scenario is functional
  now

1.34 (2012-06-20)
-----------------

- Changed the scenario information window. It now:
  - Shows all the headers and fields from the import new scenario screen
  - Adds scenario id, attachments
  To do:
  - some nice things of the old version should be included, like the graph
  - some things have unexpected 'missing' values (like 999) and we don't
    filter for them yet

1.33 (2012-06-15)
-----------------

- Add south migrations for all the apps.
